No defined conflict reported. Lao-Vietnamese collaboration has led to a close end to any notable confrontation within Lao borders. Pockets of resistance still exist. Hmong who fled to Thailand have since been forcibly repatriated; others immigrated to the U.S. as well as French Guiana. Plots for a revolution or a coup in Laos initiated by Hmong citizens living in the U.S have been alleged yet no conclusive public evidence has been brought forth thus far.
