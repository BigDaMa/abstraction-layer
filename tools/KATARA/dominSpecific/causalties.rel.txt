Invasion of Poland	causalties	Germany:ref|The discrepancy in German casualties can be attributed to the fact that some German statistics still listed soldiers as missing decades after the war. Today the most common and accepted numbers are: 8,082 to 16,343 KIA, 320 to 5,029 MIA, 27,280 to 34,136 WIA. For comparison, in his 1939 speech following the Polish Campaign Adolf Hitler presented these German figures: 10,576 KIA, 30,222 WIA, and 3,400 MIA. According to early Allied estimates, including those of the Polish government-in-exile, the number of German KIA casualties was 90,000 and WIA casualties was 200,000\n\nEquipment losses are given as 832 German tanks  of with approximately 236 to 341 as irrecoverable losses and approximately 319 other armored vehicles as irrecoverable losses (including 165 Panzer Spahwagen \u2013 of them 101 as irrecoverable losses) 522\u2013561 German planes (including 246\u2013285 destroyed and 276 damaged), 1 German minelayer (M-85) and 1 German torpedo ship (\
