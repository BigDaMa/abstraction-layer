# Abstraction Layer

The heterogeneity of different data cleaning tools makes it difficult to use them. Abstraction layer is an easy-to-use project for working with different data cleaning tools. In particular, the abstraction layer provides simple APIs for running data cleaning tools on datasets and evaluating them. 


## Installation
To install the module, make sure that you already have installed Python 2.7 and Oracle Java 1.8 on your system. Furthermore, some of the underlying data cleaning tools need to be installed. For example, to install NADEEF, you need to check its installation instructions.
